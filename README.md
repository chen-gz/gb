## Personal Blog System

Check out the [example page](https://blog.ggeta.com/).

### Key Features
1. Built using **Go** with an **SQL** database, this dynamic blog system allows you to update posts anytime with ease.
2. Supports mathematical notation, with pre-processing of markdown for seamless LaTeX integration, so you can write equations without any issues.

### Current Limitations
1. The project is still a work in progress, with many features missing or not fully optimized for production.
2. The configuration is currently managed through a static file, which is not ideal for generating dynamic configurations.
